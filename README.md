# Phishing URL Detection using NLP and Sequence Models
Darshan Raju
# Overview
This repository contains the Phishing URL Detection System using NLP and Sequence Models, which was created as part of the research project "Phishing URL Detection using NLP and Sequence Models: A Comparative Study of Character-Level CNN-GRU and Transformer Approaches".
The system investigates how sequence learning architectures applied to raw URL strings can improve phishing detection accuracy while being transparent and interpretable using attention mechanisms and explainable AI methodologies.
Traditional phishing classifiers frequently achieve high accuracy, but provide no insight into why a specific URL is identified. This study addresses that gap by combining deep sequence models, specifically CharCNN-GRU with Attention and DistilBERT transformers, to provide human-interpretable insights into model decision-making via character-level attention visualization.
# Research Goal
To design and evaluate a deep learning-based phishing URL detection system capable of:

Detecting phishing URLs using character-level sequence patterns (e.g., suspicious TLDs, delimiter bursts, encoded fragments)
Explaining classification outcomes for human analysts and security teams through attention maps
Balancing performance, interpretability, and practical deployment in real-world security operations
